/**
 * Switching to another `Adaptation` and or `Representation` can necessitate a
 * complete reload of the MediaSource.
 *
 * This is done through the `INeedsMediaSourceReload` event which among other
 * things indicate the position the player should seek to after "reloading".
 * That position depends on the playback conditions at the time of the switch.
 *
 * When you already know you have to reload, you can call this function to take
 * care of that complex behavior:
 *
 *   - If `period` is not being played when that function is called, this
 *     function will emit regularly the `INeedsMediaSourceReload` event after
 *     applying the given `deltaPos` value to the reloading position.
 *
 *   - If `period` is not being when that function is called, it emits regularly
 *     the `INeedsMediaSourceReload` without applying the given `deltaPos` value
 *     to the reloading position.
 *     This is because that value is only applied when the previous Adaptation
 *     or Representation for the current Period was being played and should not
 *     be for cases like entering the current Period, or seeking _into_ th
 *     current Period.
 *     The main point of that configuration variable being to give back some
 *     context, there is no context to give back on those cases (as the Period
 *     was not already playing).
 *
 * @param {Object} period - The Period linked to the Adaptation or
 * Representation that you want to switch to.
 * @param {Observable} clock$ - Observable emitting playback conditions.
 * Has to emit last playback conditions immediately on subscribe.
 * @param {number} deltaPos - If the concerned Period is playing at the time
 * this function is called, we will add this value, in seconds, to the current
 * position to indicate the position we should reload at.
 * This value allows to give back context (by replaying some media data) after
 * a switch.
 * @returns {Observable}
